# Recipe Engine
Self-hosted recipe management system built with Java + Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, containerised with Docker and deployed on fly.io.

Designed to let users store and browse structured recipes, with ingredients, amounts, tags, and dietary flags.

The system follows a clean architecture approach with separation of DTOs, entities, and controllers, and uses Spring Data JPA for persistence, Flyway for versioned schema migrations, and MapStruct for entityâ€“DTO mapping.

The RESTful API currently supports creating, listing, retrieving, and deleting recipes, with planned extensions for filtering, sorting, and ingredients management. A custom Gumloop workflow integrates with the backend to parse recipes from external URLs and automatically convert ingredient units into UK/metric values.

A lightweight frontend (HTML + JavaScript) provides a simple interface for adding recipes by URL and viewing the stored collection.
